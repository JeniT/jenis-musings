<p><a href="http://www.tso.co.uk/" title="The Stationery Office">The Stationery Office</a>, where I&#39;ve been working as a contractor for the last two years, is looking (rather desperately) for two &quot;content developers&quot; to work in Norwich in a permanent capacity for around Â£38-42k.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>They seem to be advertising through agencies, so it&#39;s hard to tell exactly which job adverts are theirs, but I think they might be these ones for a <a href="http://www.jobserve.com/W5FFDB73053157ED0.jsjob">XML/XSLT Content Developer</a> and a <a href="http://www.jobserve.com/W47C96754AB112898.jsjob">XML Content Developer</a>.</p>

<p>From what I gather, the two roles both require core XML skills, including XSLT and XML Schema, but on top of that TSO are looking in particular for:</p>

<ul>
<li>someone who is familiar with XML databases, XQuery, and the delivery of web-based applications based on XML</li>
<li>someone who is familiar with the semantic web, RDF, RDFa, ontologies, SPARQL and so on</li>
</ul>

<p>I find the work challenging and interesting, and particularly enjoy the fact that most of the content we deal with is public-sector information. If you want to know more, feel free to email me, or send your CV to <a href="mailto:paul.appleby@tso.co.uk" title="Email Paul Appleby">Paul Appleby</a> and mention that you heard about the job here.</p>

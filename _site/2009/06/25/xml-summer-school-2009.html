<p>Registration has just opened for this year&#39;s <a href="http://xmlsummerschool.com/">XML Summer School</a>, held in Oxford on 20-25th September. I&#39;m teaching a couple of sessions and helping with a workshop on the <a href="http://xmlsummerschool.com/curriculum2009/xslt-xsl-fo-and-xquery/">&quot;XSLT, XSL-FO and XQuery&quot; track</a> along with <a href="http://www.snee.com/bob/">Bob DuCharme</a>, <a href="http://saxonica.blogharbor.com/blog/cmd=view_user/username=mhkay">Michael Kay</a> and <a href="http://www.datypic.com/">Priscilla Walmsley</a>. It&#39;s one of my favourite events, for three reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I get to listen to experts talk about particular technologies in depth. The sessions are particularly good because they&#39;re provided by people who don&#39;t just spend all their time training, but actually practice what they&#39;re talking about, and therefore positively relish the kinds of discussions that normal trainers might shy away from.</li>
<li>I get to meet a whole bunch of people who are using XML in different areas: publishing, healthcare, government, you name it. In that way it&#39;s like a conference: many of the most useful conversations happen during the breaks or at the bar.</li>
<li>I get to go punting, visit Oxford&#39;s best pubs and dress up for a formal dinner -- more social engagements in a single week than I usually have in a year!</li>
</ul>

<p>I know a lot of beginners go to the XML Summer School for the <a href="http://xmlsummerschool.com/curriculum2009/hands-on-intro/">introduction course</a>, but to me the real value is for people who are actually using XML on a day to day basis and want to keep on top of the latest tools and technologies that will actually help them do their jobs. I learn something new every year.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted to blog about it because there&#39;s a discount on <a href="http://xmlsummerschool.com/registration2009/">registration</a> up until 30th June. Grab &#39;em while you can!</p>

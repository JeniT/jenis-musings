<p>If you&#39;re anywhere near Oxford on the weekend of the 11-12th July, and are interested in parsing, querying and manipulating RDF(a) in a browser, come along to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery">rdfQuery</a> Dazzle (hack days). The <a href="http://swig.networkedplanet.com/dazzle.html">official page</a> lists some of the things we might work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Applications: widgets, adding to existing RDFa sites</li>
<li>Core development: documentation, packaging, microformats, named graphs, and ontologies</li>
<li>Interfaces: Talis change markup, N3 and Turtle, and SPARQL</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s free to attend, you can come for either or both days, and refreshments, entertainment and wifi will be provided, so <a href="http://rdfquery.eventbrite.com/">register now</a>!</p>

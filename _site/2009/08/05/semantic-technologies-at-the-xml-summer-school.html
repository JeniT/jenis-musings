<p>I <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/107">posted before</a> about the joys of the <a href="http://www.xmlsummerschool.com/">XML Summer School</a>: the learning, the punting, the drinking! Now the <a href="http://xmlsummerschool.com/curriculum2009/semantic-technologies/">Semantic Technologies</a> track has been fleshed out to include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob DuCharme giving an overview on the semantic web</li>
<li>Leigh Dodds talking about publishing linked data</li>
<li>Andy Seabourne talking about SPARQL</li>
<li>Duncan Hall talking about creating ontologies</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s not really XML, I suppose, but it&#39;s certainly a bunch of interesting and timely topics. I particularly hope that we&#39;ll get some public sector people in the room so that we can discuss some of the challenges and opportunities in that area.</p>

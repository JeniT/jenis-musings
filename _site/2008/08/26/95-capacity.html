<p>The other day I finally got around to watching the first episode of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/britainfromabove/" title="BBC: Britain From Above">Britain From Above</a>. The episode talked about the various networks that keep Britain working: water, sewage, electricity, gas, road, shipping, trains, telecommunications and so on. </p>

<p>One segment was about the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/britainfromabove/stories/transport/railways.shtml" title="BBC: Britain From Above: Railways in Rush Hour">railway system during the rush hour</a> (might only be viewable by those in the UK). The description runs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transport expert Jon Shaw reveals that every morning as millions of people start their long commute to work they are using a system which is so overloaded it is on the brink of disaster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently the railway system (around London, at least) operates at 95% capacity during the rush hour, which means that if one small thing goes wrong, the system collapses.</p>

<p>Sounds like my life! Working and looking after the children, and keeping up with blogs and mailing lists puts me at 95%. Then I try to push it that little bit more: some extra preparation for a training course; a short article for a magazine; a technical review on a book. And then something unexpected happens: a child gets chicken pox, or starts vomiting, or my tooth needs a root canal, and I collapse.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, for the first time in 15 years, I had a proper full-on migraine that wiped me out for seven hours and lingered for another 24. (I get the visual disturbances, and sometimes even problems reading, a couple of times a year, but usually manage to avoid the actual headache.) It&#39;s my body&#39;s way of telling me to stop and slow down for a while.</p>

<p>But I still have that reviewing to do, and the children are just about to wake up from their nap, and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/restful-json" title="Google Group: restful-json">RESTful JSON discussion</a> is pretty interesting, and supper needs preparing, and I really have to try <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2008/projects/calabash" title="Calabash: XProc Implementation">Norm&#39;s XProc implementation</a>, and weed the vegetables, and write another <a href="http://news.oreilly.com/2008/07/xrx-performing-updates.html" title="xml.com: XRX: Performing Updates">XRX post for xml.com</a> as well as about this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development" title="Wikipedia: Behavior Driven Development">behaviour-driven development</a> framework I&#39;ve been developing for XSLT, and sew in the labels on my eldest&#39;s school uniform...</p>

<p>Sigh. I&#39;m not doing too well at lowering the load. Perhaps I should work at increasing the capacity.</p>

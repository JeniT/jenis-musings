<p>I&#39;ve started blogging on <a href="http://www.xml.com/" title="XML.com">XML.com</a>. There&#39;ll be rather less XML on this blog as a consequence, but I do plan to keep it going for less XML-related posts. My first post is about <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2008/05/bad_xml.html" title="XML.com: Bad XML">Bad XML</a>; read and enjoy. FWIW, if you didn&#39;t already know, I&#39;m also now on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/JeniT" title="twitter: JeniT">twitter</a>.</p>

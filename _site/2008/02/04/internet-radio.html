<p>When my dad introduced me to his internet radios, I thought, &quot;wow, there&#39;s something for everyone!&quot; So I went looking for something for <em>me</em>. And yesterday I found it: <a href="http://www.kinkfm.com/kinkclassx/" title="Kink ClassX Internet Radio">Kink ClassX</a>. It plays &quot;alternative&quot; music from the 60s to the present day. I listened to Bowie, Marilyn Manson, Arethra Franklin, Squeeze, Souxie, Otis Redding, the White Stripes: a really diverse set of music, with one thing in common -- All Good.</p>

<p>OK, so you have to sit through german-language new bulletins every hour on the hour, but to me that just adds to the charm.</p>

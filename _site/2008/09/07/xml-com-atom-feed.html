<p>I haven&#39;t been posting here very much of late because my XML-related posts (which tends to be most of them) have been going on <a href="http://www.xml.com/" title="O&#39;Reilly: xml.com">xml.com</a>. When I joined xml.com, the promise was more exposure with a wider audience. Then they changed the blogging system, and changed it again, and by now I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any audience at all!</p>

<p>However O&#39;Reilly have, finally, provided author-based Atom feeds. So if you want to subscribe to my future xml.com posts, the crucial URL is <a href="feed://broadcast.oreilly.com/jeni-tennison/atom.xml" title="O&#39;Reilly Broadcast: Jeni Tennison: Atom feed">feed://broadcast.oreilly.com/jeni-tennison/atom.xml</a>. If you want to see my previous posts, they can be found under the &quot;blog&quot; tab on my <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/3407" title="O&#39;Reilly Author: Jeni Tennison">author page</a>.</p>

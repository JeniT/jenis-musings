<p>It&#39;s XTech 2008 next week. I&#39;ll be there to talk about the work we  at <a href="http://www.tso.co.uk/" title="The Stationery Office">TSO</a> have been doing with <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/" title="Office of Public Sector Information">OPSI</a> to add semantic information to the <a href="http://www.london-gazette.gov.uk/" title="The London Gazette">London Gazette</a> using RDFa. It&#39;s really interesting and timely work on all sorts of levels; you can <a href="http://2008.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/528" title="XTech 2008: SemWebbing the London Gazette">read the abstract of the talk</a> to get a taster and of course it&#39;ll be published afterwards.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was just browsing through the schedule and it struck me how few women they were speaking. Looking at the <a href="http://2008.xtech.org/public/schedule/speakers" title="XTech 2008: Speakers">speaker list</a>, out of the 64 speakers, just <strong>three</strong> are women. Three! That&#39;s not even 5%!</p>

<p>Looking back at last year, it was a little better, at nine out of 94, which is getting towards 10%. It wasn&#39;t much better at XML 2007, where nine of the 82 speakers (11%) were female. At Extreme 2007, eight of the 60 speakers (13%) were women.</p>

<p>I wonder whether there are a low proportion of women attending these conferences generally, or whether women attend in higher proportions but don&#39;t submit papers, or whether they submit papers but a smaller proportion are accepted.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you&#39;re a woman who&#39;s going to XTech 2008 and you want to get together to <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=MMb8Csll9Ws" title="YouTube: Women, Know Your Limits!">talk about kittens</a>, drop me a line.</p>

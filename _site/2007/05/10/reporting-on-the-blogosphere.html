<p>I noticed what I think is a new phenomenon earlier this week, while reading my daily paper. This is an extract from an <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2519036.ece" title="Portugal prays for missing toddler as police investigation comes under attack">Independent story</a> about the abduction of a toddler from a holiday resort:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the UK, the distraught parents were criticised in internet chat rooms for allowing their children to be out of their sight. [snip]</p>

<p>Some bloggers taking part in discussions threads on the internet since the news broke have claimed that as well-paid professionals the couple should have known better than to leave the children unsupervised. [snip]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course I&#39;ve seen stories about blogging and internet use in newspapers before, but this is the first time that I&#39;ve noticed a mainstream news article reporting on what internet users were saying about a mainstream news story.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to be moving to a new house soon, and one of the first things I intend to do is get a compost bin. We produce an inordinate amount of food waste in our house, at least partly due to two small children who can be quite fussy eaters, so I&#39;m looking for a compost bin that takes cooked food as well as vegetable peelings and the like (ie a digester as well as a composter).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.greencone.com/product-view.asp?prid=28" title="Green Cone: Green Johanna">Green Johanna</a> looks like it&#39;ll do the job perfectly, and actually <a href="http://www.greencone.com/using.asp?prid=28" title="How to compost with a Green Johanna">benefits from a mix of waste</a> so will take our cardboard too! Plus it comes with a little coat for winter. How sweet. It&#39;s on the expensive side, but <a href="http://www.recyclenow.com/home_composting/" title="Recycle Now">Recycle Now</a> shows that there&#39;s roughly a 25% discount in my area, plus a whole pound off for shopping online.</p>

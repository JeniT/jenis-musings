<p>I guess it&#39;s an indication of something (like just being indexed by Google) when you first get comment spam on your blog. Anyway, I really don&#39;t want to insist that commentators create accounts here, so after several annoying days of repeatedly deleting spam comments, I installed the <a href="http://www.drupal.org" title="Drupal">Drupal</a> <a href="http://drupal.org/project/spam" title="Spam module">Spam module</a> and every spam comment since has been captured.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Of course it hasn&#39;t been tested for false positives yet, so send those comments flying in and see if you can trip the Bayesian filters.</p>

<p>You might notice that I&#39;ve also reconfigured the feed so that you get the full post rather than just the teaser if you&#39;re reading via an aggregator. I hope that&#39;s more convenient.</p>

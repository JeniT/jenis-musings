<p>So first there was the <a href="http://www.xmlsummerschool.com/" title="Oxford XML Summer School">XML Summer School</a>. This year was my sixth, and it was really great to hang out with <a href="http://www.xmlsummerschool.com/speakers.html" title="XML Summer School Speakers List">chums</a> old and new. I love that</p>

<ul>
<li>you get to meet people from all corners of the XML community, even ones you haven&#39;t got the slightest interest in, and learn that they&#39;re human too (even the web services guys)</li>
<li>there&#39;s always <em>something</em> to learn; I&#39;ve seen some talks for six years on the trot, others were completely new this year, but they&#39;re all worth attending because the audience, war stories and discussion are always different. Also, because each talk is aimed at newcomers, you get a great overview of topics that you&#39;re not so familiar with, and you can always chat to the speaker later to find out more</li>
<li>there are social events laid on every evening that you&#39;re expected to attend, so you&#39;re practically forced to socialise, which is useful for an insecure introvert like me who&#39;d otherwise be sitting in her hotel room getting miserable imagining everyone else having a good time</li>
<li>there&#39;s a creche, so despite being inseparable from two small children over the last four years, I&#39;ve still been able to attend without dragging an entourage with me (not that I object to the entourage, just the expense and the dependency)</li>
</ul>

<p>I left feeling not only invigorated and inspired, but also a part of a fun and friendly community.</p>

<p>The following week, we moved house. Twelve days later, we&#39;re <em>almost</em> completely unpacked, and the important things are done. We have wireless, positioned nicely so that virtually the whole house gets &quot;Excellent&quot; coverage. Thanks to my father, we have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSLU2" title="Wikipedia: NSLU2">NSLU2</a> running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian" title="Wikipedia: Debian">Debian</a> and acting as our low-power-consumption file and mail server. (For those that are interested, I&#39;m getting access from my Windows machines using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xming" title="Wikipedia: Xming">Xming</a> to actually interact with the machine, and <a href="http://www.webdrive.com/" title="South River Technologies">WebDrive</a> to map a drive onto the file system.) And we have an area entirely dedicated to Lego. Yes, this might be my dream house.</p>

<p>(We&#39;re also only a 40 minute drive from Heathrow, 30 minute train from Waterloo, so if anyone I know&#39;s visiting the UK and wants to drop in, you&#39;re more than welcome. There&#39;s even a spare room.)</p>

<p>And amongst all this, I had to record a <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/extreme/Creole.zip" title="Zipped Powerpoint with linked sound files">virtual presentation</a> on <a href="http://www.lmnl.org/wiki/Creole" title="Creole: schema language for overlapping markup">Creole</a> for <a href="http://www.extrememarkup.com/overlap/index.html" title="International Workshop on Markup of Overlapping Structures">Overlap day</a> at <a href="http://www.extrememarkup.com/" title="Extreme Markup Languages Conference">Extreme</a>. The sound quality&#39;s not great, but it&#39;s a reasonable 10-minute introduction, I think. It sounds like they got good attendance: will someone who was there please post about it?</p>

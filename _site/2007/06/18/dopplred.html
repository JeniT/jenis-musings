<p><a href="http://norman.walsh.name/" title="Norm&#39;s blog">Norm Walsh</a> invited me onto <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/" title="Dopplr">Dopplr</a>, and like a fool I joined. Why, oh why, did I bother? I never leave home. All my &quot;fellow travellers&quot; know where I am. And it just makes me jealous knowing they&#39;re jetting off to... let&#39;s see... Montreal, Sebastapol, San Francisco, Redmond, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Limoges, San Jose, Toulouse, Berlin, Seattle, Monterey, Lahaina, Tokyo, Geneva, Naples, Prague, and so on.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ll pretend my immobility is a principled stance against superfluous air travel.</p>

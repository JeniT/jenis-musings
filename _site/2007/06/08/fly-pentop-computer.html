<p>My dad got me a <a href="http://www.flypentop.com/" title="FLY pentop computer">FLY pentop computer</a> for my birthday! Basically, it lets you draw your own interface on special paper: draw a box, some numbers, some operators and an equals sign, and you&#39;ve got a calculator; draw a keyboard and some circles for drums, and you can make music; write details of an appointment, and it&#39;ll store it and repeat it at the designated time.</p>

<p>Yes, I knew that they were aimed at 8-13 year olds and I&#39;m... hrm... a couple of years (well, let&#39;s be honest, decades) outside that age bracket, but I don&#39;t think either of us realised quite what &quot;aimed at 8-13 year olds&quot; would actually mean.</p>

<p>It comes with special stickers that will make the pen make a farting noise.</p>

<p>Enough said.</p>

<p>The most annoying thing? The technology is <strong>so cool</strong>! It does handwriting recognition (albeit only capital case), and can recognise and repeat something like 70,000 words. That&#39;s just with the built-in firmware. And it has a moderate amount of built-in memory. The recharging dock comes with a USB socket. Wouldn&#39;t you think that they&#39;d release some kind of developer&#39;s kit for the budding 8-13 year old hackers? Or that someone, somewhere, somehow, had managed to hack it anyway?</p>

<p>Ah well, at least I can rest assured that it will make me popular (for about 15 minutes) with fellow geeks... and any 8-13 year olds I happen to come across.</p>

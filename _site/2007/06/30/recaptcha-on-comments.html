<p>I&#39;ve installed <a href="http://drupal.org/project/recaptcha" title="reCAPTCHA Drupal Module">reCAPTCHA Drupal module</a> as a way of combating the large amount of comment spam that I get on this blog, and to support the <a href="http://recaptcha.net/" title="reCAPTCHA: Stop Spam, Read Books">reCAPTCHA</a> project. What a fantastic idea! I see that there&#39;s already a term for using human expertise in a fun or transparent way to solve problems that can&#39;t be solved by computers: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/bionic_software_1.html" title="Tim O&#39;Reilly on Bionic Software">bionic software</a>.</p>

<p>ReCAPTCHAs are fun and add to human knowledge, but if you want to avoid them (they do take a little time to load) then <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/user/register" title="Create a new account">create yourself a login</a>. On the other hand, if you have some spare cycles, then you can <a href="http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html">do reCAPTCHAs</a> on the reCAPTCHA site without creating lots of comments here.</p>

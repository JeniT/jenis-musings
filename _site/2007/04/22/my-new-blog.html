<p>So I finally have just enough spare capacity to start blogging. And if <a href="http://blog.jclark.com/" title="James Clark&#39;s Random Thoughts">James Clark</a> and <a href="http://dpcarlisle.blogspot.com/" title="David Carlisle&#39;s Blog">David Carlisle</a> can join the party late, why not me. (Yes, M. David Peterson, your <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/04/hello_david_carlisle.html" title="Post by M. David Peterson welcoming David Carlisle&#39;s blog">eveel plan</a> is coming to fruition.)</p>

<p>So what can you expect? Well, naturally there&#39;ll be musings about XML, XSLT, schema languages and so on, including tips and tricks as I think of them. I&#39;ll probably also have a few rants about overlapping markup, particularly <a href="http://www.lmnlwiki.org/" title="LMNL Wiki">LMNL</a> and <a href="http://www.lmnlwiki.org/index.php/Creole" title="Creole: schema language for overlapping markup">Creole</a>. And anything else that sparks my interest.</p>

<h3>Blogging Software</h3>

<p>For those who are interested, I&#39;m using <a href="http://www.drupal.org/" title="Main Drupal site">Drupal</a> for content management after a fairly successful trial run with a private blog about two years ago. Drupal seems to have moved on fair bit in that time, and even if set-up wasn&#39;t exactly &quot;a breeze&quot;, it was way easier than last time, even doing it on a machine I don&#39;t own.</p>

<p>This is a fairly minimal installation at the moment. The only thing I&#39;ve added is the ability to use <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markdown syntax documentation">Markdown syntax</a> when writing content (including comments). My experience with the <a href="http://www.lmnlwiki.org/" title="LMNL Wiki">LMNL Wiki</a> is that, even for a markup geek like me, it&#39;s a lot easier to generate content if you don&#39;t have to write tags, but conversely I can&#39;t stomach the lack of control of WYSIWYG. I couldn&#39;t find a Drupal input format for Wiki-style input (at least, I found the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/pearwiki_filter" title="PEAR Wiki Filter Drupal module">PEAR Text_Wiki</a> module but couldn&#39;t get it to create <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements successfully, and since I intend to write code samples on this blog, that made it pretty useless), and Markdown seems a pretty usable alternative.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably be adding more modules as time goes on and the need arises. If there&#39;s anything you, as readers, want added then let me know, particularly if you can point me at the relevant Drupal module.</p>

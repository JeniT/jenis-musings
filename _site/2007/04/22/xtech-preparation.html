<p><a href="http://2007.xtech.org/" title="XTech 2007">XTech 2007</a> is less than a month away! I&#39;m going to be presenting on <a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/77" title="Summary of my XTech 2007 paper">Creole: Validating Overlapping Markup</a> in the Core Technologies track on Wednesday 16th May at 16:00. Yes, I know it&#39;s really an <a href="http://www.extrememarkup.com/" title="Extreme Markup Languages Conference">Extreme</a> paper, but (a) I&#39;m not going to Extreme this year, (b) I&#39;ll be reaching out to a slightly wider audience, and (c) I just cannot wait any longer to talk about <a href="http://www.lmnlwiki.org/index.php/Creole" title="Composable regular expressions for overlapping languages etc.">Creole</a>!</p>

<p>The only trouble is: how am I going to make overlapping markup interesting to all the Web 2.0 geeks? More to the point: how do I explain the elegance of Brzozowski derivatives without losing at least half the audience?</p>

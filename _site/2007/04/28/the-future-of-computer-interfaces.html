<p>My dad (Hello Barry!) has much more time to surf than I do, and often sends me interesting links. One that he sent recently was a <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/65" title="Jeff Han: Unveiling the genius of multi-touch interface design">video presentation of a multi-touch interface</a> that&#39;s really worth checking out. I thought I&#39;d just write down a few of my thoughts on that and one of the talks at <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/events/2006/DocEng2006/" title="ACM Symposium on Document Engineering 2006">DocEng 2006</a> on interactive paper, since they&#39;re both about how we might interact with computers in more intuitive ways in the future.</p>

<p>There&#39;s apparently a multi-touch interface on the <a href="http://www.everyipod.com/iphone-faq/iphone-how-multi-touch-interface-works-when-developed.html" title="iPhone Q&amp;A">iPhone</a>, but <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/65" title="Jeff Han: Unveiling the genius of multi-touch interface design">Jeff Han&#39;s presentation</a> on a huge multi-touch screen is really awe-inspiring. The obvious applications are when manipulating graphics: touch an image with two fingers, then move them apart to zoom, or around each other to rotate; touch an image with four fingers, and move them in concert to skew. Jeff Han shows this with both a graphics package and a 3D map similar to <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth">Google Earth</a>.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s be honest, most of the time we mark-up geeks spend on computers we spend reading and writing. What multi-touch gestures could we use on documents? Proper touch-screen keyboards: being able to actually hold down the Shift/Ctrl/Alt keys in combination rather than them acting as switches. Doing a copy operation by &quot;holding down&quot; highlighted text with one finger while you move it with another. Using a kind of vertical &quot;pinch&quot; to delete or hide lines, and a horizontal one to do the same for characters... There are things you could do, but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d give a big enough usability win to drive multi-touch adoption. The main problem, I think, is screen real-estate: if you&#39;ve got a laptop, the screen size is not that much bigger than a keyboard, so there&#39;s hardly any room left to actually display what you&#39;re writing. So my guess is that multi-touch will mainly be used on large displays -- communal displays and (literally) desktops -- and in the graphics/CAD world.</p>

<p>I owned a tablet for a while, and for the most part I used it as a normal laptop. The one task that I really found easier in tablet mode was reading and annotating documents. That&#39;s because it gave the experience that was closest to paper: I could hold it close, page through easily, and highlight things I wanted to comment on, and make the comments themselves, using the pen. (This was several years ago now: at the time I couldn&#39;t actually write on the document itself, now you get proper &quot;ink annotations&quot; in Word.) How are we going to read documents in the future?</p>

<p>There&#39;s the long-term promise of flexible screens, but I learned about <a href="http://www.anoto.com/" title="Anoto">Anoto</a> in one of the many interesting talks at <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/events/2006/DocEng2006/" title="ACM Symposium on Document Engineering 2006">DocEng 2006</a>: <a href="http://www.globis.ethz.ch/script/publication/download?docid=435" title="Print-n-Link: Weaving the  Paper Web">Print-n-Link: Weaving the Paper Web</a> by Moira C. Norrie, Beat Signer and Nadir Weibel. Anoto uses a pattern of dots arranged around a grid and printed (very faintly) on paper. The pens have a small camera that sees the dots and therefore knows where, on the page, they are. This information can be used by the pen itself or transferred to a computer. Mostly this is aimed at business types who can take hand-written notes during a meeting on a special Anoto notepad, and then transfer them to their computer later on. The sweetest application, though, is in the <a href="http://www.flypentop.com/" title="Fly Pentop computer">Fly Pentop computer</a>, which is aimed at school children: you can do things like draw a calculator anywhere on your notepad and then use it to perform calculations by hitting the buttons with your pen. I <em>really</em> want one!</p>

<p>Norrie, Signer &amp; Weibel presented a system for printing academic articles plus the Anoto dots, such that when you tap on a reference on a printed article with your Anoto pen, the referenced article comes up on your computer screen. Beat Signer controlled and annotated the presentation using the pen on a printed version of the slides. So cool.</p>

<p>The real innovation here, I think, was actually printing documents with the Anoto dots and having document-specific behaviour associated with them. It provides a way of getting annotations (mark-up!) on your document by having the smarts in a pen rather than a tablet PC. Of course the &quot;display&quot; can&#39;t update (except for the fact that you&#39;ve actually written on it), but you don&#39;t need that when you&#39;re reviewing documents. There&#39;s more of Norrie, Signer &amp; Weibel&#39;s research on the <a href="http://www.globis.ethz.ch/research/paper/" title="Interactive Paper">GlobIS website</a> but I haven&#39;t had the time to look at it.</p>

<p>Know of any other funky user-interface innovations on the horizon? Tell me about them!</p>

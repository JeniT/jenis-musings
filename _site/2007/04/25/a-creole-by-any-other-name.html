<p>Argh. I&#39;ve been contacted by the guys at <a href="http://www.wikicreole.org" title="Creole Wiki Markup language">WikiCreole</a> who want me to change the name of <a href="http://www.lmnlwiki.org" title="Creole schema language">Creole</a>. What should I do? Not only is &quot;Creole&quot; a great name for a schema language that deals with concurrent markup, but it&#39;s a great acronym too (Composable regular expressions for overlapping languages etc.)</p>

<p>I did Google when I first came up with the name in August 2006, but didn&#39;t discover WikiCreole (unsurprisingly, since it was only coined in July 2006 itself). But now far more many people know, care about and use WikiCreole than Creole grammars. So any suggestions for alternative names?</p>

<p>I recently filled in a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=yrLrPneVwzAm50dPNax3gQ_3d_3d" title="Survey on Robots in Computer Science Education">questionnaire</a> that asked about the use of robots in teaching programming. (You can win a robot!) Some of the questions seemed to be particularly about attracting women into the field; I guess the thinking is that programming something that does something in the real world is more engaging (particularly for women?) than doing artificial exercises in linked list manipulation. Or something.</p>

<p>I like programming robots as much as the next geek, and am the proud owner of two regular <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/" title="Lego Mindstorms NXT">Lego Mindstorms</a> kits as well as a less complex, but more evil, Dark Side Developers Kit. Thinking around this, it struck me that there are two classes of projects you can do with robots:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <strong>directive</strong> program, where you tell the robot exactly what to do (go forward for 5 seconds, turn, forward for 2 seconds etc.)</li>
<li>a <strong>facilitative</strong> program, where you define the feedback between sensors and motors, then just let the robot go</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but these two classes of projects seem like they might be associated with masculine and feminine approaches to dealing with children. There was a great <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/tv_and_radio/child_of_our_time/" title="BBC: Child of Our Time">Child of Our Time</a> episode a couple of years ago where parents helped their children draw a house on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch" title="Wikipedia: Etch A Sketch">Etch A Sketch</a>. The fathers basically took over the controls -- &quot;turn yours... keep going... stop&quot; -- whereas the mothers let the child do it while uttering general words of encouragement. Both approaches are absolutely necessary for a child to learn how to do it on their own: they can&#39;t know what to do unless they&#39;re told, and they can&#39;t learn to do it themselves unless they&#39;re given space to try.</p>

<p>So I wonder whether programming in a directive way is more attractive to masculine people and programming in a facilitative way is more attractive to feminine people. Of course it&#39;s kind of hard to simply <em>encourage</em> a computer to do something, but I certainly find it more engaging to see how <em>little</em> I need to tell a robot to do in order to get interesting behaviour. My favourite robot projects were creating ones that would locate and hide in the darkest part of a room (through a combination of random and goal-oriented movement), and setting up two kits to &quot;sing&quot; with each other (each responding to the others&#39; song in a feedback loop). In other words, simple programs that elicit complex behaviour simply by being used in a complex environment. (XSLT programming can be like this as well: the art of creating complex XSL-FO/HTML from complex XML with as little intervention as possible.)</p>

<p>Actually, I don&#39;t think that simply programming robots would be any more attractive to women than other kinds of programming. What matters, I think, is whether there&#39;s a real <em>task</em> to achieve. So getting a robot to do something useful, like vacuuming or tidying away toys, would be attractive. But equally so would designing a diary application, or a community website. Programming in the abstract isn&#39;t exciting, but being able to do something with a program is. (And surely it can&#39;t just be women who feel like that?)</p>

<p>I learnt two new life-skills today.</p>

<p>First, how to tie my shoelaces using the <a href="http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm" title="Ian&#39;s Shoelace Site: the Ian Knot">Ian Knot</a>. It&#39;s very quick, and works just as well with anything with loops, such as supermarket or nappy bags.</p>

<p>Second, how to make playdoh. A standard recipe all over the web is:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 cup flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup salt</li>
<li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
<li>1 cup water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon food colouring</li>
</ul>

<p>You mix the flour, salt and cream of tartar together in a big saucepan, then gradually add the liquids and stir continuously over a low heat until it becomes a ball. It looks really liquid and gloopy at first, then suddenly, bam, its playdoh. It&#39;s more squidgy than the stuff you buy, but that just makes it all the better for rolling and cutting and squooching and so on. You <em>can</em> add glitter and other things, but I didn&#39;t today. And apparently it&#39;s bad for pets.</p>

<p>I actually couldn&#39;t find any cream of tartar at the local shop, so substituted the 2 teaspoons cream of tartar with 6 teaspoons vinegar, which works fine but gives it a rather acrid stench. Apparently another substitute for cream of tartar is lemon juice, which might smell rather better. Also you need a lot more than 1 teaspoon food colouring if you&#39;re doing it blue, as I was -- more like half a bottle or more.</p>

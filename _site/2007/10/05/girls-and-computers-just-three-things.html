<p>One: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/womenintech/2007/09/12/bringing-up-girl-geeks.html" title="OReilly: Women in Technology: Bringing Up Girl Geeks by Jeni Tennison">My article</a> in the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/womenintech/" title="OReilly: Women in Technology Series">Women in Technology</a> series came out about a month ago. It was actually inspired by <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/30#comment-3544" title="Jeni&#39;s Musings: How To Get Women into Computing: Comment">this comment</a> on the post I wrote a while ago on women in computing, which asked about encouraging your daughters to take up computing. I found it easier to write about that than my own experiences, which have been rather mundane.</p>

<p>Two: Read <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_17/109-OMG-Girlz-Don-t-Exist-on-teh-Intarweb-1" title="Escapist Magazine: OMG Girlz Don&#39;t Exist on teh Intarweb!!!!">OMG Girlz Don&#39;t Exist on teh Intarweb!!!!</a>. It&#39;d be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so dreadful.</p>

<p>Three: We&#39;ve been looking at possible infant (ages 4-7) schools for our eldest. The two nearest both have interactive whiteboards in all the classrooms and regular IT lessons. In one school, the children are taught how to touch type; this at an age when they can hardly read and write. When I was in school, touch typing was on typewriters, for the girls who aspired to be secretaries. (I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavis_Beacon_Teaches_Typing" title="Wikipedia: Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing">Mavis Beacon</a>&#39;d myself during my year out of university; it&#39;s the most frequently used skill I have next to the ability to read.)</p>

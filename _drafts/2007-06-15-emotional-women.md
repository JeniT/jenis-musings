[Lauren Wood][1]'s [pointed][2] to a blog post about [the barriers women face in tech communities][3], which focuses on the different communication styles of men and women, such as:

> Destructive criticism is the best way to keep a site predominantly male. It implies that there is no concern about whether a person can learn from a response or not, or whether they would find offense. It is an outward display of ego, a territorial “pissing rite” in which most women do not and will not participate.

One of the [responses][4] to that post included:

> As for the aggressive nature of the discussions, again, considering that I'm also seen as a 'aggressive' communicator, I don't know if communication style is the problem as much as lack of respect and the communication only reflects this. To me, the larger issue is that women in tech are not as respected as the men, and hence our work is more easily discredited or ignored, our contributions downplayed, our participation compromised. Worse, when we do get into passionate discussion, our arguments tend to be discredited using the too typical 'shrill' or my personal favorite, 'hysterical'.

Men can't win, right? If they're strident and opinionated then they're

I was struck by a particular quote in [an article][7] I read recently in the [Cambridge Evening News][8] about the new Cambridge mayor and mayoress, who are both (male-to-female) transgender people (and both software engineers):

> "When I was transitioning I was very emotional. The hormones aren't kind to you. When I started taking them it was as if men live in black and white and women live in colour; women have so many emotions men just don't have.
> "I get really upset when I shouldn't; it's lovely and it's horrible. But I can't imagine going back to that bland black and white world."

We don't generally get to experience what it's like being the other gender; this statement, from someone who has, really brought home to me that our physical, particularly hormonal, differences might entail psychological differences.

I do think that women are more emotional than men. And this being the case, that on low days or in bad moments we can interpret comments in the worst possible way and react badly in ways that perhaps men don't do so often. But I don't think that it's particularly *men's* communication that we misinterpret, though. Rather, it's the aftermath that's handled differently. With a woman I might feel inclined to say, "Sorry, I'm having a bad day." and expect that to be understood. But to admit to a man that my arguments might be affected by the time of the month, or a bad day with the children, would be laying myself open to ridicule.

In computing, and science in general, we're somehow supposed to be able to discuss problems in an entirely rational manner, unbiased by any personal investment we might have in a particular approach; our history with a particular product or company; relationships with the people we're debating with; or our mental and emotional state. But the fact is that life isn't like that. We all bring a huge amount of baggage to any discussion we contribute to.

Conversely, "being emotional" is somehow equated (by both men and women) with being hysterical, irrational, unpredictable and generally very difficult to deal with. But having emotions isn't a negative thing, it's a human thing. And it can be positive: emotional investment in an idea, a technology or a project, can give you energy, make you willing to stand up and argue your point, and infect others with your enthusiasm.

So let's cut each other (and ourselves) some slack.
